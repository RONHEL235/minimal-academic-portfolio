      "A breakdown of Procrustean Bed for AI-Driven Retrosynthesis and why current evaluation metrics reward impossible chemistry.",
    content: `
## Motivation
AI retrosynthesis benchmarks reward routes that look valid but collapse under chemical scrutiny.

## The problem with current evals
Most systems optimise for success rate, not feasibility.

## Infrastructure as the bottleneck
Scientific progress is constrained by tooling, not ideas.

## Conclusion
We need infrastructure-first thinking for AI chemistry.

      "Cursor is dying because cost-optimization forces models into tunnel vision.",
    content: `
## Cursor's original promise
Cursor worked because it privileged context over cleverness.

## Why RAG agents fail
Search-based context is always incomplete.

## The 2026 workflow
Large context windows, manual control, fewer abstractions.
